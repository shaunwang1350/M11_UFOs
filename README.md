# M11_UFOs
### Background

In this challenge, I created additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors. The webpage and dynamic table Dana has built are working as intended, but Dana has decided she would like the table to be filtered even further. While it currently filters by the date, she would like to include the ability to filter by more column headers. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

### Objectives

The goals of this challenge are to:
* Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters. (Date, City, State, Country, Shape)
* Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
* Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

### Technology Used
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Chrome Developer Tool

### Note
* I discovered a more efficient way of filtering through all of the inputs provided by the user. It eliminates the use of additional funciont (filterTable()) and was able to do so without a forEach loop. This meant that the runtime for the app was much faster. 
* I have included a commented out version of what is asked from the criteria. This includes the additional filterTable Function and the forEach loop. This is intend to display that I have done the work. 
* I added a reset button as an additional feature on the website. 

### Further Development Recommendation
* A further development recommendation would be to add a show-all feature on the website. Currently, without any filters, the website displays all of the data which creates a really long page. If there is a feature that can show only the first 5 rows and then with a click expands the table, that would make the website alot more aesthetic.
