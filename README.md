# UFOs
### Background

This project includes retrieves an API that includes all of the latest sightings of UFOs (Dataset of over 150+ UFOs sightings). The data then is ported into Bootstrap and uses Javascript dynamic functions / filters to transform the data. Filters include: Date, City, State, Country, Shape. 

### Objectives

The goals of this challenge are to:
* Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters. (Date, City, State, Country, Shape)
* Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
* Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

### Technology Used
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Chrome Developer Tool

### Note
* I discovered a more efficient way of filtering through all of the inputs provided by the user. It eliminates the use of additional funciont (filterTable()) and was able to do so without a forEach loop. This meant that the runtime for the app was much faster. 
* I have included a commented out version of what is asked from the criteria. This includes the additional filterTable Function and the forEach loop. This is intend to display that I have done the work. 
* I added a reset button as an additional feature on the website. 

### Further Development Recommendation
* A further development recommendation would be to add a show-all feature on the website. Currently, without any filters, the website displays all of the data which creates a really long page. If there is a feature that can show only the first 5 rows and then with a click expands the table, that would make the website alot more aesthetic.
